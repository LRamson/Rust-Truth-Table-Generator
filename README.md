Simple Truth Table Generator written in the Rust Programming Language.

Just a fun side project to learn a bit more about manipulating Strings with the language.
V1 is just a Truth Table Generator, but I may add some additional stuff in the future, like universal quantifiers (those may be a bit tricky!)
